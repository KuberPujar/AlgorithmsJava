Sliding window in bit manipulation involves using bitwise operations to maintain a dynamic window of fixed-size bit sequences while iterating through a binary value, optimising computations by reusing previously calculated results.

# Sliding Window in Bit Manipulation
This technique is particularly useful for problems where you need to evaluate a sequence of bits or perform operations on a subset of bits in a binary number.
## Key Concepts
- **Bitwise Operations**: Using AND, OR, XOR, NOT to manipulate bits.
- **Dynamic Window**: Adjusting the size of the window as you iterate through the bits.
- **Efficiency**: Reducing the number of operations by reusing results from previous calculations.
- **Fixed Size**: Often used with a fixed number of bits, such as 32 or 64 bits.
- **Masking**: Using masks to isolate specific bits within the window.
- **Shifting**: Using bit shifts to move the window across the binary number.
- **Counting Bits**: Keeping track of the number of bits set or cleared within the window.
- **Sliding Window Technique**: Moving the window across the bits to evaluate different segments without recalculating everything from scratch.
- **Applications**: Useful in problems like finding the maximum or minimum value in a sliding window of bits, counting specific patterns, or evaluating bit sequences for certain conditions.
- **Performance**: Often leads to O(n) complexity for problems that would otherwise require O(n^2) or worse, by avoiding redundant calculations.
- **Bit Masks**: Creating masks to isolate or manipulate specific bits within the window.
- **Bit Counting**: Efficiently counting the number of set bits (1s) or cleared bits (0s) within the current window.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Using bitwise operations to perform calculations on the bits within the window.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Sometimes combined with dynamic programming techniques to store intermediate results for further optimization.
- **Bit Patterns**: Recognizing and manipulating specific patterns of bits within the sliding window.
- **Bit Shifting**: Using left and right shifts to adjust the window position and size dynamically.
- **Bitwise Comparison**: Comparing segments of bits within the window to find matches or specific conditions.
- **Bitwise Aggregation**: Aggregating results from the bits within the window, such as summing or finding the maximum value.
- **Bitwise Filtering**: Filtering bits based on certain criteria, such as keeping only those that match a specific pattern or condition.
- **Bitwise Transformation**: Transforming the bits within the window based on specific rules or operations.
- **Bitwise Optimization**: Optimizing the bit manipulation operations to reduce time complexity and improve performance.
- **Bitwise Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms that leverage bit manipulation techniques to solve problems efficiently.
- **Bitwise Data Structures**: Using data structures that support efficient bit manipulation, such as bit arrays or bitsets.
- **Bitwise Search**: Searching for specific patterns or values within the bits of the sliding window.
- **Bitwise Compression**: Compressing the bits within the window to save space or improve performance.
- **Bitwise Encoding**: Encoding information within the bits of the sliding window for efficient storage or transmission.
