Dynamic programming in bit manipulation involves using memoization or tabulation techniques to optimise and store intermediate results of bitwise operations, facilitating efficient computation of complex problems.
# Bit Manipulation Dynamic Programming
This directory contains implementations of dynamic programming algorithms that utilize bit manipulation techniques. The focus is on solving problems efficiently by leveraging the properties of bits and binary representations.
# Key Concepts
- **Bitmasking**: Using integers to represent subsets of a set, where each bit in the integer corresponds to an element in the set.
- **Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Memoization**: A technique where results of expensive function calls are cached to speed up future calls with the same parameters.
- **Tabulation**: A bottom-up approach where a table is filled iteratively to build up solutions to subproblems.
- **State Representation**: Defining the state of the problem using bits to represent various conditions or choices.
- **Transition**: Defining how to move from one state to another using bitwise operations.
- **Base Cases**: Identifying the simplest cases of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion or iteration.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyzing the time and space complexity of the algorithm, especially considering the number of bits involved.
# Examples
- **Subset Sum Problem**: Using bitmasking to represent subsets and dynamic programming to find if a subset exists with a given sum.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem**: Using bitmasking to represent visited cities and dynamic programming to find the shortest path visiting all cities.
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: Using bit manipulation to efficiently track and update the longest increasing subsequence in a sequence of numbers.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Using bitmasking to represent items included in the knapsack and dynamic programming to maximize the total value.
- **Game Theory Problems**: Using bit manipulation to represent game states and dynamic programming to find optimal strategies.
- **Graph Problems**: Using bit manipulation to represent edges and vertices in graphs, and dynamic programming to solve shortest path or connectivity problems.
- **String Matching**: Using bit manipulation to efficiently check for substrings or patterns within larger strings using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Using bit manipulation to represent different matrix multiplication orders and dynamic programming to find the optimal order.
- **Partition Problems**: Using bitmasking to represent partitions of sets and dynamic programming to find valid partitions that meet certain criteria.
- **Combinatorial Problems**: Using bit manipulation to efficiently count combinations or arrangements of elements in sets, leveraging dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Using bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and shifts to manipulate bits directly in the context of dynamic programming problems.
