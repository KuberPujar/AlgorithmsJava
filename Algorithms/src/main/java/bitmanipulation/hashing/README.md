Hashing in bit manipulation involves mapping data to fixed-size values using bitwise operations, allowing efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data represented in binary form.
# Hashing in Bit Manipulation
Hashing is a technique used in computer science to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. In the context of bit manipulation, hashing often involves using bitwise operations to efficiently compute these values. This can be particularly useful for tasks such as data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
## Key Concepts
- **Hash Functions**: Functions that take an input (or 'key') and return a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a hash code.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Operations that directly manipulate bits of binary numbers, such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts.
- **Collision**: Occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash output. Good hash functions minimize collisions.
- **Load Factor**: A measure of how full a hash table is, defined as the number of entries divided by the number of buckets. A higher load factor can lead to more collisions.
- **Rehashing**: The process of resizing a hash table and recalculating the hash values for existing entries, typically done when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Chaining**: A method of handling collisions in hash tables by storing multiple elements that hash to the same index in a linked list or another data structure.
- **Open Addressing**: A collision resolution method where, upon a collision, the algorithm searches for the next available slot in the hash table.
- **Perfect Hashing**: A hashing technique that guarantees no collisions for a specific set of keys, often used in static sets where the keys are known in advance.
- **Universal Hashing**: A method of selecting a hash function at random from a family of hash functions to minimize the chance of collisions for any input set.
- **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Specialized hash functions designed to be secure against attacks, ensuring that even a small change in input results in a significantly different output.
- **Bloom Filters**: A space-efficient probabilistic data structure that can test whether an element is a member of a set, allowing for false positives but no false negatives.
- **Hash Tables**: Data structures that implement an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values using hash functions.
- **Hash Maps**: A type of hash table that uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
- **Hash Sets**: A collection that contains no duplicate elements and uses a hash function to determine the storage location of each element.
- **Hash Collisions**: Situations where two different inputs produce the same hash output, which can lead to inefficiencies in data retrieval and storage.
