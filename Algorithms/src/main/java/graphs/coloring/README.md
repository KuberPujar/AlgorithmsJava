Coloring in Graphs refers to assigning colors to the vertices or edges of a graph based on certain rules or constraints, often used in graph problems like graph coloring or scheduling.

# Graph Coloring
Graph coloring is a way of labeling the vertices of a graph with colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is useful in various applications, such as scheduling problems, register allocation in compilers, and frequency assignment in mobile networks.
# Graph Coloring Algorithms
## Greedy Coloring
The greedy coloring algorithm is a simple and efficient way to color a graph. It works by iterating through the vertices of the graph and assigning the smallest available color that has not been used by its adjacent vertices.
```java
public class GreedyColoring {
    public static void greedyColoring(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        boolean[] available = new boolean[n];

        for (int u = 0; u < n; u++) {
            // Reset available colors
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                available[i] = true;
            }

            // Mark colors of adjacent vertices as unavailable
            for (int v : graph[u]) {
                if (result[v] != -1) {
                    available[result[v]] = false;
                }
            }

            // Find the first available color
            int color;
            for (color = 0; color < n; color++) {
                if (available[color]) {
                    break;
                }
            }

            result[u] = color; // Assign the found color
        }

        // Print the result
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println("Vertex " + i + " ---> Color " + result[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
## Backtracking Coloring
Backtracking is a more exhaustive approach to graph coloring, which tries to assign colors to vertices while ensuring that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. If a conflict arises, it backtracks and tries a different color.
```java
public class BacktrackingColoring {
    public static boolean isSafe(int v, int[][] graph, int[] color, int c) {
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            if (graph[v][i] == 1 && color[i] == c) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static boolean graphColoringUtil(int[][] graph, int m, int[] color, int v) {
        if (v == graph.length) {
            return true; // All vertices are colored
        }

        for (int c = 1; c <= m; c++) {
            if (isSafe(v, graph, color, c)) {
                color[v] = c; // Assign color

                if (graphColoringUtil(graph, m, color, v + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }

                color[v] = 0; // Backtrack
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void graphColoring(int[][] graph, int m) {
        int[] color = new int[graph.length];
        if (!graphColoringUtil(graph, m, color, 0)) {
            System.out.println("Solution does not exist");
            return;
        }

        // Print the result
        for (int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Vertex " + i + " ---> Color " + color[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
## Welsh-Powell Algorithm
The Welsh-Powell algorithm is a greedy algorithm that colors the vertices of a graph in a specific order, starting with the vertex of the highest degree. It ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
```java
public class WelshPowellColoring {
    public static void welshPowellColoring(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] degree = new int[n];
        boolean[] colored = new boolean[n];
        int[] color = new int[n];

        // Calculate the degree of each vertex
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j : graph[i]) {
                degree[i]++;
            }
        }

        // Sort vertices by degree in descending order
        Integer[] vertices = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            vertices[i] = i;
        }
        Arrays.sort(vertices, (a, b) -> degree[b] - degree[a]);

        // Color the vertices
        for (int u : vertices) {
            if (!colored[u]) {
                color[u] = 1; // Assign first color
                colored[u] = true;

                for (int v : graph[u]) {
                    if (!colored[v]) {
                        color[v] = 2; // Assign second color
                        colored[v] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the result
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println("Vertex " + i + " ---> Color " + color[i]);
        }
    }
}
```
