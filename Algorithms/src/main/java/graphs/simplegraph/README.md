A Simple Graph is a non-directed graph where edges represent relationships or connections between vertices, without considering their weights or directions.

# Simple Graph
A simple graph is a type of graph in which each pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge, and no edge connects a vertex to itself (no loops). This means that:
- There are no multiple edges between any two vertices.
- There are no self-loops (edges that connect a vertex to itself).
- The graph can be either directed or undirected, but in the context of a simple graph, it is typically undirected.
- The graph can be represented using an adjacency list or an adjacency matrix.
- The degree of a vertex in a simple graph is the number of edges connected to it.
- A simple graph can be connected or disconnected, meaning that there may or may not be a path between every pair of vertices.
- A simple graph can be finite or infinite, depending on the number of vertices and edges it contains.
- A simple graph can be used to model various real-world scenarios, such as social networks, transportation systems, and communication networks.
- A simple graph can be traversed using various algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore its structure and find paths between vertices.
- A simple graph can be represented in various ways, including adjacency lists, adjacency matrices, and edge lists, depending on the specific requirements of the application or algorithm being used.
- A simple graph can be used to represent relationships between objects, where vertices represent the objects and edges represent the relationships between them.
- A simple graph can be used to solve various problems, such as finding the shortest path between two vertices, detecting cycles, and determining connectivity between vertices.
- A simple graph can be used in various fields, including computer science, mathematics, physics, and social sciences, to model and analyze complex systems and relationships.
- A simple graph can be used to represent various types of relationships, such as friendships in a social network, connections in a transportation system, or dependencies in a project management scenario.
