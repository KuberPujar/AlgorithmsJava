An Eulerian Circuit is a circuit in an undirected graph that passes through each edge exactly once, often used to identify a specific type of graph connectivity or solve certain optimisation problems.
# Eulerian Circuit
An Eulerian Circuit is a closed path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. For an undirected graph to have an Eulerian Circuit, it must satisfy the following conditions:
1. All vertices with non-zero degree are connected.
2. All vertices have even degree.
3. If the graph has no edges, it is considered to have an Eulerian Circuit.
4. If the graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree, it has an Eulerian Path but not an Eulerian Circuit.
5. If the graph has more than two vertices of odd degree, it does not have an Eulerian Circuit or Path.
6. If the graph is disconnected, it cannot have an Eulerian Circuit.
7. If the graph is directed, it must have all vertices with equal in-degree and out-degree to have an Eulerian Circuit.
8. If the graph is directed, it can have an Eulerian Path if exactly one vertex has in-degree one more than out-degree, one vertex has out-degree one more than in-degree, and all other vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree.
