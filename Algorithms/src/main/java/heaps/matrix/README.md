Matrix in Heap refers to representing a heap data structure using a two-dimensional matrix or array, where each element is placed in a specific position based on the heap property, facilitating efficient heap operations.
# Matrix in Heap
This module provides an implementation of a matrix-based heap data structure. The matrix is used to represent the heap, allowing for efficient access and manipulation of elements while maintaining the heap properties.
## Features
- Efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- Support for both min-heap and max-heap configurations.
- Dynamic resizing of the matrix to accommodate more elements.
- Traversal methods to access elements in the heap.
- Utility methods for heap operations such as finding the minimum or maximum element, checking if the heap is empty, and clearing the heap.
- Support for heapify operations to maintain the heap property after insertions or deletions.
- Customizable comparator for defining the order of elements in the heap.
- Serialization and deserialization of the heap structure for persistence.
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access.
- Integration with other data structures for advanced operations like merging heaps or converting between different heap representations.
