Mode ID's
Given two integer arrays, arr and freq, each of length n, you are tasked with tracking the most frequent IDs in a dynamic collection that changes over time. Hereâ€™s how the arrays work:

arr[i] represents an ID at step
freq[i] indicates the change in the count of arr[i] at step i.
For each step i:

If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] instances of arr[i] are added to the collection.
If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] instances of arr[i] are removed from the collection.
Your goal is to construct an array ans of length n where each element ans[i] contains the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after step i. If the collection is empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step.

Example1:
Input:

 arr = [5,5,3], freq = [2,-2,1]
Output:

[2,0,1]
Explanation:

After step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2.
After step 1, there are no IDs. So ans[1] = 0.
After step 2, we have 1 ID with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 1.
Example2:
Input:

 arr = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1]
Output:

[3,3,2,2]
Explanation:

After step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2. So ans[0] = 3.
After step 1, we have 3 IDs with value of 2 and 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[1] = mode of IDs = 3.
After step 2, we have 2 ID with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 2.
After step 3, we have 2 IDs with value of 2 and 1 ID with the value of 1. So ans[3] = mode of IDs = 2.
Constraints:

1 <= arr.length == freq.length <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105
-105 <= freq[i] <= 105
freq[i] != 0
The input is generated such that the occurrences of an ID will not be negative in any step.
The function should return the result.
