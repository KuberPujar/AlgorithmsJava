Hashing in Heap involves using a hash function to map elements or attributes to specific positions or values in a heap data structure, enhancing search, insertion, or deletion operations.
# Hashing in Heap
Hashing in heaps is a technique that combines the properties of hash tables with heap data structures to optimize certain operations, such as searching, inserting, or deleting elements. This approach can improve performance in scenarios where quick access to elements is required.
## Key Concepts
- **Hash Function**: A function that takes an input (or 'key') and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a hash code that is used to index into a hash table.
- **Heap Structure**: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where each parent node is greater than or equal to (max-heap) or less than or equal to (min-heap) its child nodes.
- **Collision Resolution**: Techniques used to handle cases where two keys hash to the same index in a hash table, such as chaining or open addressing.
