Sorting in Heap involves using a heap data structure to sort a collection of elements in ascending or descending order, typically achieved through techniques like Heap Sort or Priority Queue.
# Sorting in Heap
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It works by first building a max heap (or min heap) from the input data, and then repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap to build the sorted output.
## Key Concepts
- **Heap**: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where each parent node is greater than (or less than) its child nodes.
- **Heap Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap to sort elements in O(n log n) time complexity.
- **Max Heap**: A binary heap where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- **Min Heap**: A binary heap where the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
- **Priority Queue**: An abstract data type that supports efficient retrieval of the highest (or lowest) priority element, often implemented using heaps.
- **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
- **Deletion**: Removing the root element (maximum or minimum) from the heap and restructuring it to maintain the heap property.
- **Heapify**: The process of converting a binary tree into a heap by rearranging its elements to satisfy the heap property.
- **Heapify Down**: A process to maintain the heap property by moving a node down the tree until it is in the correct position.
- **Heapify Up**: A process to maintain the heap property by moving a node up the tree until it is in the correct position.
- **Build Heap**: The process of creating a heap from an unsorted array by applying the heapify operation.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of heap sort is O(n log n) for the sorting process, and O(n) for building the heap.
- **Space Complexity**: Heap sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, requiring O(1) additional space for the sorting process, but O(n) space for the input array.
- **Applications**: Heap sort is used in various applications such as priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and in scenarios where a stable sorting algorithm is not required.
- **Advantages**: Heap sort is efficient for large datasets, has a guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity, and does not require additional memory for sorting.
- **Disadvantages**: Heap sort is not a stable sort, meaning that it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements, and it can be slower than other algorithms like quicksort or mergesort in practice due to its constant factors.
