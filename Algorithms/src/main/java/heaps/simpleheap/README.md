A Simple Heap is a data structure that maintains a partially ordered binary tree, where each node is greater (or smaller) than its children, commonly used for efficient insertion, deletion, or retrieval of the minimum (or maximum) element.

# Simple Heap
A Simple Heap is a data structure that maintains a partially ordered binary tree, where each node is greater (or smaller) than its children, commonly used for efficient insertion, deletion, or retrieval of the minimum (or maximum) element.
# Simple Heap Implementation
The Simple Heap implementation in this repository provides a basic structure for a heap, allowing for operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the minimum or maximum element. The implementation is designed to be efficient and easy to use, making it suitable for various applications where priority queue functionality is required.
# Features
- **Insertion**: Add elements to the heap while maintaining the heap property.
- **Deletion**: Remove the minimum (or maximum) element from the heap and re-structure the heap.
- **Retrieval**: Access the minimum (or maximum) element without removing it.
- **Efficiency**: Operations are designed to be efficient, with logarithmic time complexity for insertion and deletion.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used for various applications, such as priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and more.
- **Easy to Use**: The implementation is straightforward, making it easy to integrate into existing projects or use as a learning tool for understanding heap data structures.
- **Customizable**: The heap can be customized to work with different data types or comparison functions, allowing for maximum or minimum heaps as needed.
- **Robustness**: The implementation includes error handling for edge cases, such as attempting to delete from an empty heap or accessing elements in an invalid state.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is provided to help users understand the implementation and its usage, including examples and explanations of the underlying algorithms.
- **Testing**: The implementation includes unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability, making it suitable for production use.
