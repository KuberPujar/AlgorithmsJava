Binary Search in Heap refers to using a heap data structure to perform a binary search on a sorted collection of elements, reducing the search space in each iteration for efficient searching.
# Binary Search in Heap
Binary Search in Heap is a technique that combines the properties of binary search with the structure of a heap. It allows for efficient searching within a sorted collection of elements stored in a heap data structure.
## Key Concepts
- **Heap Structure**: A binary heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where each node is greater than or equal to its children (max-heap) or less than or equal to its children (min-heap).
- **Binary Search**: A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Efficiency**: Binary search in a heap can be more efficient than linear search, especially for large datasets, as it reduces the number of comparisons needed to find an element.
- **Applications**: This technique is useful in scenarios where quick lookups are required, such as in priority queues, scheduling algorithms, and graph algorithms.
